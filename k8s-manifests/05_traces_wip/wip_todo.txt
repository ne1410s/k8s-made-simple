ISSUE
Metrics (incl. custom added ones) ARE reaching Grafana/Prometheus.. BUT, the custom ones are lacking background/context:

SUGGESTIONS
- In monitoring.yml / prometheus config map, there's an entry for 'opentelemetry-metrics' job...
  --> Need to provide relabeling config; to send thru: namespace, service name, pod name, etc

-----------
ISSUE
Metrics - Should/could the "jobs" listed in prometheus be just the single one - opentelemetry-metrics.

SUGGESTIONS
- Review the configuration with the various integrating components that surface in the current prometheus target list
  --> And point them to opentel endpoints instead!!!

-----------
ISSUE
Traces should ideally be more in-depth (generically)

SUGGESTIONS
- Something like fody to generically inject Activity start code in every C# method?
- Are there other things we can do in ASP.NET startup to emit more request data, etc?
