ISSUE
Fody having to be explicitly references in every project :/
Be nice to just have a Common project for Fody..
  I think declaring [assembly: TraceThis] per project still, IS perfectly reasonable

SUGGESTIONS
- Some kind of missing package configuration
- Guidance from the Fody github / community, etc?
